# Web Crawler


This is a Java based implementation for a web-crawler which will crawl the links on a given URL and crawl the urls that are on the same domain. 

We have used following libraries for different purposes
- Jsoup: This is a Java library used for HTML parsing and manipulations
- Junit: Unit Testing library for Java
- Mockito: Test runner used for Mocking and assertions.
- exec-maven-plungin: Plugin to run application


## Running Steps:
In order to run the web crawler, use following command:
> ./mvnw clean build && ./mvnw exec:java

You can also run the Main.class in any IDE for Java.
